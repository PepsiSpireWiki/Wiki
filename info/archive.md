# Original Site Archive

As of March 2023, the official Pepsi Spire site (https://pepsispire.com) now redirects to pepsi.com.

To preserve the original site, I have reassembled the site from the assets I was able to acquire. Unfortunately, not every asset was archived before the site went offline. Those missing assets were either recreated, or left out.

> Note: The assets that make up the site are from several archives over multiple years, so some information may be outdated.
